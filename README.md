## My Thoughts
This article is about the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency's growing prominence in the financial sphere. Before reading this article, I did not know that the EU was considering creating a digital Euro. This raises many interesting questions for privacy concerns because people do not want every aspect of their financial lives mapped by the government. At the same time, governments want to ensure their citizens are not evading taxes or commiting other crimes. Additionally, this sort of financial overhaul would require completely new laws and coordination among the countries that will be using the new digital currency.

It seems to me that cryptocurrency is transforming finance in a way similar to how the internet has transformed society. This is a huge change that requires proper precaution, regulation, and consideration. Obiously, though, it is very difficult to know what sort of regulations are appropriate. I am excited to see where cryptocurrency takes us in the coming years.
